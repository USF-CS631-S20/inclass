Project02 Interactive Grading

During interactive grading you will do the following steps and tests.

Connect and turn on your Raspberry Pi.

Establish an ssh connection via the shell. Make sure you use big fonts
in you terminal program so that it is easy for use to see your output.

Clone you Project02 repository into the tmp dir.

Compile nt.c. (make is best, just type "make"),.

You need to test all the example from the Project02 web page.

Then do the following

$ ./nt 0
$ ./nt 1
$ ./nt 2
$ ./nt -1
$ ./nt -2
$ ./nt 4294967295
$ ./nt 4294967296
$ ./nt 429496729600
$ ./nt 2147483647
$ ./nt -2147483648
$ ./nt -2147483649

$ ./nt 713

Feed the binary output of this as input to nt
Feed the hex output of this as intput to nt

Check results

$ ./nt -713

Feed the binary output of this as input to nt
Feed the hex output of this as intput to nt

Then using the hex for 713 (0x000002C9) do this:

$ ./nt -b 4 -r 0,3 0x000002C9

Check results.

$ ./nt -b 8 -r 0,7 0x000002C9

(base 10 signed should be negative)

$ ./nt -b 4 -r 4,7 0x000002C9

(base 10 signed should be negative)

$ ./nt
(You should see a usage message)

We will review your code in GitHub.

Your repo should be clean (no extra files).
Your code should be clean
- Consistent formating
- No commented out code
- No redundancy
- Good organization
- No overly complex code.

You should be able to explain your code.
- main()
- all conversion functions
- any data structures
